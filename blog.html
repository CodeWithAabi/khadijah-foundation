      <h2 class="impact-blog-title">Why Education Matters</h2>
      <p class="impact-blog-text">
        Education is not just a tool, it is a lifeline for orphaned and underprivileged children. In a world
        where opportunities are limited for the most vulnerable, education becomes their hope — the key that
        unlocks dignity, independence, and purpose. At Khadijah Welfare Foundation, we’re not just teaching — we
        are transforming lives. Every lesson taught is a brick laid in the foundation of a brighter future. When
        a child learns, an entire generation rises.
      </p>
      <p class="impact-blog-text">
        Islam places immense value on knowledge. The first revelation to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was: <em>“Read
          in the name of your Lord who created.”</em> (Surah Al-Alaq, 96:1). The Prophet ﷺ also said:
        <strong>“Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim.”</strong> (Sunan Ibn Majah). By helping a
        child gain Islamic and academic education, you contribute to Sadaqah Jariyah — a reward that never ends.
        Together, let’s empower hearts and minds with the light of knowledge.

      <h2>Supporting Orphans is a Prophetic Mission</h2>
      <p>
        The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, <strong>"I and the one who cares for an orphan will be together in
          Paradise like this"</strong> — and he held his two fingers together. (Sahih al-Bukhari)
      </p>
      <p>
        At Khadijah Welfare Foundation, we take this mission to heart. Orphaned children, already burdened by
        loss, deserve not just shelter and food — they deserve love, dignity, and the gift of knowledge. Our
        schools provide a nurturing Islamic environment where young girls and boys grow with confidence,
        purpose, and faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through your support, we ensure that no child is left behind. These children carry the potential to
        become scholars, leaders, and changemakers. And when you help them — even with a small donation — you
        take part in a noble mission that leads directly to Jannah.
      </p>

      <h2>Knowledge is Light — A Quranic Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        Allah ﷻ says in the Qur’an: <strong>“Are those who know equal to those who do not know?”</strong> (Surah
        Az-Zumar 39:9). Islam places immense emphasis on education — both spiritual and worldly. The Prophet ﷺ
        made it clear that seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim, male and female.
      </p>
      <p>
        At our Madressas, we don’t separate deen from dunya. Children memorize the Qur’an, understand Hadith,
        and also study subjects like math, science, and languages — all under one roof. It’s a rare model
        designed to empower underprivileged children with the tools to succeed both in this world and the next.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every pencil, book, and teacher in our classrooms represents a flame of light — a step away from
        ignorance and toward a brighter, self-sustaining future. Be a part of this journey. Illuminate a life.
